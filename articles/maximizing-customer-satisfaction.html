This problem is exacerbated in situations where there is more value in enhancing the product for potential clients than there is risk in creating discomfort for existing customers. These situations require a strong process and understanding of company goals. Otherwise, you risk not just deteriorating relationships between your customer support and engineering teams, but also doing irreparable damage to customer relations. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I&rsquo;ve seen this situation play out many times and frequently the outcome is poor. This is in many cases due to one or both parties having a poor understanding of the objective. At its root, the goal should be to improve the customer&rsquo;s condition while minimizing the impact to engineering time. In the instances where we&rsquo;ve succeeded, we&rsquo;ve kept that as our focus.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>The throwaway solution that is so frequently suggested is to do X bugs per sprint (or other arbitrary timeframe). This may appear effective, but below the surface, it&rsquo;s inefficient. The severity of bugs will vary by sprint so lower priority bugs will end up being addressed. This raises the question, if bugs are being fixed, what&rsquo;s the problem? This goes back to our objective which is the need to minimize engineering impact. If you&rsquo;re in this situation, it&rsquo;s because your engineering team is stretched thin on other </span><span class="c4">critical</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;work. Time spent developing and QAing bug fixes that will have little to no positive impact on the customer is not how we want to use our bullets. It&rsquo;s much better to have the capability to scale engineering allocation up or down based on the severity of issues.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In my experience, the best way to attack this challenge is by building a lightweight process with minimum data tracking to provide accountability and show progress.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><ul class="c6 lst-kix_psapj4z5sjrs-0 start"><li class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">A representative from engineering and customer success/support should meet on a regular cadence where bugs are brought for discussion.</span></li><li class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">This meeting is for your customer team to bring bugs, but not for your engineering team to commit to dates. The purpose is to discuss issues and their broader themes. Afterword, the engineering representative is responsible to take the bugs back to the team for estimates which can then be used in conjunction with their severity to prioritize.</span></li><li class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">It&rsquo;s important to keep a list of all issues brought to this meeting along with which have been delivered. This gives you a percentage of the issues fixed.</span></li></ul><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Note: This is not a forum for critical issues that require hotfix type releases. Those should be handled via a separate process.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Breaking down items into themes instead of treating the bugs as independent issues will pay dividends in several ways. It will show you which parts of your product the customer is most frequently hindered by. This is an important distinction between the parts of the app that the customer success and engineering teams are most bothered by. It&rsquo;s common for the internal focus to be on the wrong features and functionality. This process should shed light on internal blind spots.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Another benefit of this system is that by not immediately throwing tickets into a sprint, you can compile buckets of similar issues. It&rsquo;s more efficient for a developer to fix three bugs in a similar part of the code base in a single effort than to spread that out over a long period of time. By bucketing issues into customer themes, you significantly increase the chances that when engineering evaluates one issue, they will be able to address related issues in the same effort. This has had an overwhelmingly positive effect for our customers because they see not just their reported issue get addressed, but also other issues in its near vicinity getting fixed at the same time.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Finally, and probably my favorite part of this process, is that the discussion between your customer and engineering teams often uncovers things that wouldn&rsquo;t otherwise be discovered. It&rsquo;s common for a customer to report what they believe to be a bug, but not fully explain the problem they&rsquo;re trying to solve. This creates the scenario where you address the bug, but you don&rsquo;t solve their problem. To go back to our goals, this creates twice the cost. We&rsquo;ve not improved the customer&rsquo;s condition, if anything, we&rsquo;ve made it worse by setting expectations that there would be a fix. We&rsquo;ve also expended developer resources and will now need more work to address the root cause. Up front conversations provide a great forum to understand the problem and engineering insight often gives the customer team questions to better direct the customer.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p></body></html>
