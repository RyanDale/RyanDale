These conversations have a tendency to devolve into rampant speculation about how users are actually interacting with your application. I&rsquo;ve been shocked by how many of these conversations have been squashed by even basic user activity tracking. Product analytics have been one of my strongest allies when faced with narratives fed by case studies and speculation. Analytics have also been a driving force in showing where time and effort should be spent to address high traffic and high impact features.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>Now that we&rsquo;ve discussed </span><span class="c4">why</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;analytics are important let&rsquo;s discuss where to begin. For purposes of this blog, I&rsquo;m going to operate under the assumption resources are limited. Given that, my focus is on minimizing the impact to your engineering team while still gaining valuable insight. The following approaches are those that my teams and I have benefitted the most from.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The first place we added tracking to was page views. This is particularly simple to implement in most modern web apps. It&rsquo;s important to ensure you&rsquo;re tracking not just the page view, but also which page the user navigated from. This will allow you to replay the user&rsquo;s transitions through your application. The real value isn&rsquo;t a single user&rsquo;s activity, but the ability to identify trends on how your application is traversed. I&rsquo;ve used this data to pick up on situations where customers take the &ldquo;long way&rdquo; to perform certain workflows. This creates an opportunity to improve your user experience and communicate to customers a more efficient way to use your product. The latter in particular has been something that is received well by customers.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Many applications make heavy use of reusable components. These are a fantastic target for analytics, especially when you&rsquo;re limited on development time. As an example, one product I worked on has a file manager component that is used throughout the app. Adding a few event trackers to that component gives insight to how it&rsquo;s used as a whole as well as how it&rsquo;s used in each section of the product.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The final simple win that can make a big difference is adding trackers to places where there are two workflows to achieve the same outcome. An example of this is a product&rsquo;s search feature with both a basic and advanced option. There was an internal perception with this product that users relied heavily on the advanced search. Tracking the two workflows showed the opposite though. Over 95% of searches occured in the basic search. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">To conclude, I hope I&rsquo;ve provided some benefits that will inspire you to adopt some form of analytics as well as some target areas to get started. Product analytics provide extensive, cross functional value and are not to be overlooked.</span></p></body></html>
