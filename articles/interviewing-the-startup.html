It&rsquo;s imperative you understand what is expected from you and what the direction of the organization is. For the purpose of this blog, I&rsquo;m going to focus on financial aspects of a startup, less so on compensation or the job itself. </span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">You should never take a job at a startup without first understanding the financial situation. Does the company have any outside investors? Are they profitable on their own? If not currently profitable, what are their plans for the next several years? As you begin to dig in on the company&rsquo;s financial situation, this will give you an idea of the company&rsquo;s direction. It&rsquo;s unlikely an interviewer will outright tell you &ldquo;We have six months of runway and we&rsquo;re scrambling to survive.&rdquo; There are still opportunities to gain valuable insight through body language and what they don&rsquo;t say. This may feel like an uncomfortable line of questioning, but it&rsquo;s critical. You&rsquo;re making an investment in an organization and to fully commit, you should understand the high level of how they operate.</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">If this is your first job out of college, these may seem like irrelevant details. I can speak from experience, it&rsquo;s not. My first job out of college was at what appeared to be a self sustaining technology company. They had several enterprise customers and high profile prospects on the horizon. Upon joining the company, I learned that our largest customer was actually our parent company. Its CEO had founded this startup and maintained full ownership. That led to a lot of decisions being made in the best interest of that customer even when those decisions went against what was in the best interest of building a successful startup. It took multiple CEOs and several years to break out of that relationship. It was a significant red flag that I failed to identify because I didn&rsquo;t ask the right questions.</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">If the response to your question about funding is along the lines of &ldquo;We just received ten million in Series A funding&rdquo;, this is an opportunity to drill down and understand what the plan for that money is. Does the company want to launch a product? Are they looking to expand or create new departments? Don&rsquo;t confuse &ldquo;large&rdquo; amounts of funding for a sound business. There are countless examples of companies burning through millions of dollars. If the answers don&rsquo;t add up, it&rsquo;s something that should give you pause.</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Finally, prior to going in for an interview, I strongly advise you research the financial side of the company. Articles around the founding of the company or funding events can offer a lot of insight. You can use that information to direct pointed questions and get the perspective of those already at the company. Risk and startups go hand in hand, but it&rsquo;s invaluable to understand that risk as best you can prior to joining an organization.</span></p></body></html>
