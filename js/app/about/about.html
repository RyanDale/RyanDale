            <p>
                Passionate about the intersection of technology and business. My career began as a software engineer
                working for software start ups.  As I advanced in my career, I've been exposed to the many challenges faced
                at the business level of these type of organizations. There are so many opportunities to maximize
                efficiency that get missed for a variety of reasons. I'm driven to solve those difficult, and frequently,
                cross functional challenges.
