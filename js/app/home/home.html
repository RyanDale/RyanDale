            <span class="md-headline">Simple is better than complex.</span>
            <p>
                How many times have you heard that phrase? How many more times have you been explained a
                solution that's "too technical" to be fully comprehended? It shouldn't be that way. It's time to
                understand that while technology companies face challenging problems, the solutions to improve
                your customer's condition or to gain new customers are simpler than they seem.

                My objective is to unravel the complex problems I see working with SaaS start ups and break them down in
                a way that they can be addressed to build smarter, more efficient companies. My background is in
                software engineering and architecture, but I'm equally passionate about the business components that
                allow engineering teams to deliver high functioning results that meet organizational expectations.
